## Assignment_1
Assigment consists such structure 

```
├── Assignment 1                <- directory for source files 
|    ├── main.py                <- main script 
|    ├── delay_flights.csv      <- initial dataset 
|    ├── src                    <- all figures ...
|    └── main.ipynb             <- notebook to execute (best practise)
│                               
├── ....                        <- bla bla bla
└── Readme.md
```
